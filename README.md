### Can we break RSA by finding the Local Inverse of Encryption/Decryption maps?

’Yes’ we can some-times break the RSA and find the message(local inverse x) by using the finite sequence corresponding to the encryption map but only for small primes **p** and
**q**, with chances of success peaking at 50%(for 8 to 10 bit primes).

For decryption map **D**, based on our calculations we were never able to de-rive the local inverse, but if the length of the sequence was decently then
we could possibly find the local inverse correctly. Although it might take too much time and computation as the length increases.
